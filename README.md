# Bit by Bit ⚔️💻

Learn coding by playing. Defeat bosses using logic.

🚀 About the Project

Bit by Bit is a beginner-friendly, gamified coding platform designed for people who are new to programming or feel scared by traditional coding websites. Instead of solving abstract problems, users learn coding concepts by progressing through game-like levels and defeating bosses using code.

The goal of Bit by Bit is to make coding feel fun, approachable, and confidence-building.

🎯 Why Bit by Bit?

Many coding platforms are overwhelming for beginners. They focus on competition, complex problems, and memorization. Bit by Bit takes a different approach:

Focuses on learning step by step

Encourages trying, failing, and retrying

Uses real-world logic instead of confusing puzzles

Makes coding feel like a game, not a test

🧠 How It Works

Users start by selecting their coding experience level

Each level teaches one core programming concept

Players write code in an in-browser editor

Boss battles represent real-life logic problems

An AI guide helps users with hints and explanations (without giving full answers)
