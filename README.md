## 🚀 About the Project

Bit by Bit is a beginner-friendly, gamified coding platform designed for people who are new to programming or feel scared by traditional coding websites.

Instead of solving abstract problems, users learn coding concepts by progressing through game-like levels and defeating bosses using code.

The goal of Bit by Bit is to make coding feel fun, approachable, and confidence-building.

## 🎯 Why Bit by Bit?

Many coding platforms are overwhelming for beginners. They focus on competition, complex problems, and memorization.

Bit by Bit takes a different approach:

- Focuses on learning step by step  
- Encourages trying, failing, and retrying  
- Uses real-world logic instead of confusing puzzles  
- Makes coding feelata feel like a game, not a test

## 🧠 How It Works

- Users start by selecting their coding experience level  
- Each level teaches one core programming concept  
- Players write code in an in-browser editor  
- Boss battles represent real-world logic problems  
- An AI guide provides hints and explanations when users are stuck
